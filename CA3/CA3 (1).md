# Introduction
With this alarm clock, end-users are able to view local weather information and COVID19 
infection rates, as well as the latest top news stories from England at scheduled times of their own choice. 
Therefore, by using this service, users can keep up to date with weather and COVID19 updates of their local region as well as top British news in a highly flexible manner. Users are able to choose what type of updates they would like to get and when by entering an alarm date and time, an alarm title and by ticking checkboxes that include the different types of notifications.


# App Features

  - The app allows end-users to schedule and cancel alarms at times of their own choice
  - News, Covid and weather data are retrieved through API calls which are conducted every half an hour to minimise the number of http requests from the system and maximize efficiency.
  - The app uses text-to-speech announcements and a text-based notification list to notify the end-users to different events that take place. Text-to-speech alerts are also used for error handling (e.g. when the user tries to enter an alarm for a date that has passed).

# Prerequisites
- Python version 3.7+
- A text editor (e.g. notepad, notepad++) or an IDE (e.g. PyCharm)
- Sign up for Weather and News API
- Stable Internet Connection

# How to use the alarm service
-   When the browser is open, the user interface should include the words 'Alarms' and 'Notifications' at the left and right top corners respectively. The user should also view a clock icon at the top of the page and a title 'Daily Update' underneath. Two textfields, two checkboxes and a submit button are placed underneath the page title 'Daily Update'.  
-   The user can select the calendar icon of the first textfield to set the alarm time and date
-   The user can type an alarm title using the second textfield
-   Once the submit button has been pressed a text-to-speech announcement will notify the user that an alarm has been set for a specific date and time and then the relevant alarm data will pop up as a textbox to the alarms column on the left
-   The user can decide what kind of updates he would like to get when the relevant time is reached by ticking any or both of the checkboxes (one is for news and one for weather briefing) placed under the alarm title textfield. If no checkboxes are selected, the user is only provided with an update in local COVID19 infection rates
-   The user can cancel an alarm by pressing the x button at the top right corner of the alarm textbox
-   A text-to-speech announcement will notify the user that an alarm has gone off when the relevant time is reached
-  Text-to-speech announcements will be used for error handling. (e.g. if the user enters an alarm with a date that has already passed, an announcement will notify him that he cannot enter an alarm for that date)
-  Text-based notifications will appear at the Notifications column as textboxes with a title and content when the relevant time is reached
-  A notification can be dismissed by pressing the "x" button at the top right corner of the textbox.

# Guide for developers
- A compressed version of the project files will be provided as a single zip file. Extract all subdirectories from the zip file.
- Go to the JSON Files directory, open the config.json file and replace the API keys for the Weather and the News API with your own ones.
- In the config.json file apart from the API keys for the Weather and the News API, you can also find a key 'location' whose value is Exeter. If you are in a different city and you want to get an update for local weather and COVID19 infection rates, change the value of the location key.
- If you want to amend the code so that the updates you receive are customised to your own preferences you can have a look at the developer's guide at the following websites:
            - The developer's guide for the News API can be found at: https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/sources
            - The developer's guide for the Weather API can be found at: https://openweathermap.org/api
            - The developer's guide for the Public Health England API can be found at: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide
- You can access the config.json file and change the page image with an icon of your own preference. To do this you need to delete the current icon filepath which is stored at the 'filepaths' dictionary as the value of the key 'page_image'. Then, add there the filepath of the image you would like to have in the html interface and you are ready.
- The config.json file can also be used to change the APIs update frequency. There is a key inside the config.json file named 'update_frequency' and I've set its value to 1800 seconds since I want my program to call the three APIs (Weather,News and covid) every thirty minutes.
